Game Instructions

To Play the Frogger Arcade Game clone, open the index.html file in your web browser.  Your player, a true cat lady, will display at the bottom of the screen in the center of the row.

To maneuver your player around the board, use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys.  The player is constrained to the bounds of the game board, so they will not be able to move off screen.

The purpose of the game is move your player from the starting position, past the enemy bugs, to reach the water.  When the player has reached water, the user will have won the game,  it will automatically be returned to the the starting position.

In addition to reaching the water, if a player collides with an enemy bug, the player will be returned to the starting position.  Be careful, because enemy bug movement will vary in speed, and can be unpredictable.

That's it, pretty straight forward!
